ASSETS FOLDER - REQUIRED IMAGES

This folder should contain the following image files for the Sotkis application to work properly:

1. background.png
   - Default background image for the dashboard
   - Should be a high-quality image that works well with the dark theme
   - Recommended size: 1920x1080 or larger

2. backgroundBL.png  
   - Blurred background image for content pages
   - Same image as background.png but with blur effect applied
   - Used when navigating to pages other than dashboard

3. backgroundlogin.png
   - Background image for the login modal
   - Should be a professional image related to waste management or technology
   - Recommended size: 1920x1080 or larger

4. logo.png
   - Sotkis company logo
   - Should be transparent background (PNG format)
   - Recommended size: 200x200 or appropriate aspect ratio

IMPORTANT NOTES:
- All images should be optimized for web use
- Use PNG format for logos and images that need transparency
- Use JPG format for background images if transparency is not needed
- Ensure images are properly licensed for commercial use

PLACEHOLDER CONTENT:
Until the actual images are provided, the application will show broken image placeholders.
The functionality will still work, but the visual experience will be incomplete.

To add images:
1. Place the image files in this assets/ folder
2. Ensure the filenames match exactly (case-sensitive)
3. Refresh the application in the browser
